# The For Loop

The `for` statement creates a loop with three optional expressions

`for (arg1,arg2, arg3){
    // what to excecute
}`

1. Arg1 - executed (once) before executing the block of code
2. Arg2 - defines the conditions or the terms for executing the code block
3. Arg3 - it is executed after every code block executed

Loop scope

- variables declared using `var` can be accessed out of the scope
- let and const are scoped in the execution context
