# TikTok Projects

This repository serves as a central hub for all my TikTok-related projects. Each folder inside this repo represents a standalone project (e.g., scripts, automation tools, data analysis, creative effects, or experiments).

## 📂 Structure

```

```

- Each project lives in its own folder.
- Every project should have its own **README.md** with details on setup, usage, and purpose.
- Shared utilities or common code (if any) can be placed in a top-level `utils/` folder.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techwithtwin/tiktok-projects.git
   cd tiktok-projects
   ```
2. Navigate into any project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project-name-1
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in that project’s README.

## 📝 Notes

- This repo is only a container; each subproject may be private, experimental, or work-in-progress.
- Over time, successful or polished projects can be moved into their own standalone repos.
